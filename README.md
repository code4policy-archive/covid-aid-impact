This is a website that was created for a class project. The goal of the project was to build a website that helps international development students and other researchers or interested stakeholders to understand how Covid influenced the big trends in international aid flows. By using a big data source from the OECD we built two interactive maps for a data-driven analysys. We also suggest an example for how this data can be used on the country level so beginners can see the implications of this data even if they are not experts on this issue.
